1. Configure platformio-ide-terminal in Atom. Installed the package yesterday but failed to get it working. After some tweaks, I found there was an error saying the package was built for an older version of Atom. Rebuilding the package fixes the issue.

2. Ran the weather_checker2.0.py and found there was issue when inputting an invalid command. Adding try .. except to the else part solved the problem.

3. Got tab/space mix issue when coding. Set tab to 4 spaces and use soft tab according to a StackOverflow post. But it doesn't seem to work. Ended with making invisible characters visible and then copy & paste.

1. How to get the server copy and replace the local one:

```
git checkout path/to/file.
```

2. Use [apscheduler.triggers.cron](http://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/modules/triggers/cron.html#module-apscheduler.triggers.cron) to trigger the whether check program every day.

3. How to get the current time?

```
import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(str(now))
```

## 0825

1. Set up [Gitbook](https://rachelj.gitbooks.io/learn-python/) to hold my documentation.
2. Some minor update to guess_advanced01.py in Chap0.

## 0826

1. Optimize the Chap0 guess_advanced01.py code from using global variables to using class.
2. Add requests module info to Gitbook.

My Python format issues:

1. Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
2. Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.
3. For comments, you should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period.
4. Comments shoule be complete sentences. If a comment is a phrase or sentence, its first word should be capitalized
5. Code alignment

    ```
    weather_result = (
        query + "天气" + data['HeWeather5'][0]['now']['cond']['txt'] +
        ","  # print the weather
        + "风向为" + data['HeWeather5'][0]['now']['wind']['dir'] +
        ","  # print the wind direction
        + "气温为" + data['HeWeather5'][0]['now']['tmp'] +
        "。"  # print the temperature
        + "更新时间" + data['HeWeather5'][0]['basic']['update']['loc'] + "。"
    )  # print the update time
    ```
    ```
    url = "https://free-api.heweather.com/v5/now?city=%s&key=%s" % (
        city, key)  # url for checking real-time weather
    ```

6. How to align operators

    ```
    # Yes: easy to match operators with operands
    income = (gross_wages
              + taxable_interest
              + (dividends -
    qualified_dividends)
              - ira_deduction
              - student_loan_interest)
    ```
