Time: 2hrs

Did what:

* optimized the code of ex35.py
* did ex37: list and check the keywords, data types, string escape sequences, string formats, operators
* wrote a little program to verify the different string formats

Review:

* How to verify an integer input? Use try/except

```python
data = raw_input('Enter a number: ')
try:
    number = int(data)
except ValueError:
    print "I am afraid %s is not a number" % data
else:
    if number > 0:
        print "%s is a good number" % number
    else:
        print "Please enter a positive integer"
```
