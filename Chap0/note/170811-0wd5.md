## Time: 
3.5 hrs

## Did what:

* convert 3 python2 programs to python3 (1 hr)
* wrote guess_advanced.py (2.5 hrs)
* wrote a little program to verify the different string formats

## Review:

* Can Python generate a random number that excludes a set of numbers, without using recursion?

   using **random.choice()**

  ```python
  import random
  allowed_values = list(range(-5, 5+1))
  allowed_values.remove(0)

  # can be anything in {-5, ..., 5} \ {0}:
  random_value = random.choice(allowed_values) 
  ```

* [What is the difference between FROM random IMPORT* and IMPORT random? ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6695798/what-is-the-difference-between-from-random-import-and-import-random-random)

* use Command + ] for indent on macOS

* Print Combining Strings and Numbers

   ```python
   first = 10
   second = 20
   
   print "First number is {first} and number is {second}".format(first=first, second=second)
   
   print "First number is", first, "and second number is", second
   ```
