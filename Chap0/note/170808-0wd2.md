学习时间： 2.5h

教材：learn python the hard way

练习笨方法ex29-33
installed python3 

复盘：
* learned if, elif, else
* learned while loop
* converted ex33 from python2 to python3: print -> print()

改进计划：
* Don't forget the colon after if
* When converting ex33 to a function, I got an issue that the loop doesn't ends. The cause was that I took the max number from raw_input(), which is of wrong data type. Making it int(raw_input()) solved the problem.
