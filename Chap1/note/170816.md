## Did what

Fix the value passing issue of ex42.

Type and learned several interesting Python programs:

* Google_News: open the Google news RSS and print out the item summaries. Got timeout issue when using the Google URL, switched to Dynamsoft blog RSS and it worked

  ```python
  import bs4
  # Beautiful Soup 是一个可以从HTML或XML文件中提取数据的Python库
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup
  from urllib.request import urlopen
  ```
* SimpleStopWatch: A very simple program to print the time lapse between Enter & Ctrl+C for stop
```Python
import time
```

* WikipediaModule: search a term in wikipedia and print out the results. Need to use pip to install the wikipedia module first before running the program.

Saw some error. Will fix tmr.
