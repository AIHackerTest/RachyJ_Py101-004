1. Wrote guess_advanced01.py with exception processing and add functions to make the code structure clearer.

2. Met the issue on passing variables between functions. Check the [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16043797/python-passing-variables-between-functions) and there are mainly two ways:
  1. passing variables as parameters of funtions

  ```
  def defineAList():
      local_list = ['1','2','3']
      print "For checking purposes: in defineAList, list is", local_list
      return local_list

  def useTheList(passed_list):
      print "For checking purposes: in useTheList, list is", passed_list

  def main():
      # returned list is ignored
      returned_list = defineAList()   

      # passed_list inside useTheList is set to what is returned from defineAList
      useTheList(returned_list)

  main()
  ```

  2. use global variables

  ```
  l = []

  def defineAList():
      global l
      l.extend(['1','2','3'])

  def main():
      global l
      defineAList()
      useTheList(l)
  ```
3. how to check the type of a value

print(type(value))

4. use isinstance() to verify the value type and len() to check the digits

```
if(isinstance(int(guess), int) and (len(guess) == 4)):# check if the input is an integer and it's of 4 digits
        check_digit(guess, answer)
```
