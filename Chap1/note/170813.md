# Did what

* Installed Atom but failed to configure Github
* Tried to get Github command line working but failed..
* Learned the command line cheatsheet 
* Wrote the ch1 task and complete 3 features. To complete the history part tomorrow.

# Review

* So many tools to get familiar with..
* The program seems easier than I thought which is good. Maybe I'm more competent than I thought.
* The basic operators are not so familiar, need to get back to the LYTHW book and look up, e.g. list [], dictionary {}
